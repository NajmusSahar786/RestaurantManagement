@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
@* 

  Without the viewstart.cshtml file,we set the layout property in each and every view
  this violates DRY Principle
  To Use a different layout file,all the indiviudual views need to be updated.

  ViewStart.cshtml- is a special file in asp.net core MVC

  The code in this file is executed before the code in an individual view is executed.
  So this means instead of setting the layout property in each individual view ,we can
  move that ode into the _ViewStart.cshtml file
