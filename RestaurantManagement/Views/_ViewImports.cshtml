@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@* 
_ViewImports.cshtml is a feature in asp.net core mvc thar enables 
you to add common namespaces ,directives and other elements
to multiple views without having to add  these namespaces ,directives to 
every individual view
 It essentially serves as a way to include common code that should be available 
 to all views in the same directory or in directories. The _ViewImports.cshtml 
 file works similarly to how web.config or app.config files work for configuration settings,
e.g

@addTagHelper: directive is used to  make the built in tag helpers available for all the views in our entire 
application using _ViewImports.cshtml file 
e.g. @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

@using :The @using directive is used to include the 
common namespaces globally so that you don’t have to include the namespaces in each 
and every view page.

@model: The @model directive is used to specify the Model for your view.
